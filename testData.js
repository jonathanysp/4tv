Romney was clinging to a one percentage point lead over Obama in Thursday's Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, up 47 percent to 46 percent for Obama.\nA new ABC News/Washington Post poll showed how Romney has made up ground since defeating Obama in the first of their three presidential debates on October 3. The poll had Romney up by 50 percent to 47 percent among likely voters.\nRomney charged that electing Obama would return Washington to a \"status-quo path,\" a path that \"doesn't have an answer about how to get the economy going.\"\n\"The path we're on does not have new answers,\" said Romney, whose campaign has been centered around ways to create jobs in the sputtering economy.\nPOWELL BOOST\nPowell's endorsement was a milestone for the president in his re-election bid but since he had backed Obama four years ago, it did not have the same impact this time around.\nPowell was a secretary of state during the presidency of Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. He told CBS he is sticking with Obama because the economy is improving.\n\"The unemployment rate is too high. People are still hurting in housing. But I see that we are starting to rise up,\" he said.\nObama has generated large crowds during a two-day, eight-state tour that is taking him to Iowa, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, California, Illinois and Virginia.\nSome 8,500 people showed up for an early morning rally in Tampa, Florida on Thursday and some 15,000 came out for the president in Richmond, Virginia.\nThe president has sought to rev up enthusiasm and momentum in those crowds by talking about his cross-country trip.\n\"We are right in the middle of our 48-hour fly-around campaign extravaganza,\" he said to applause in Florida. \"We pulled an all-nighter last night!\"\nThe election will likely be decided in a handful of swing states where the candidates are spending just about all of their time, with none of them more important than Ohio.\nThe two campaigns squabbled over who has the upper hand in Ohio, where the race is close. Democrats believe they have the edge in early voting and turn-out operation, but Republicans disagree.\n\"A steady upward trajectory among key voting blocs indicates a close race, but one that is unmistakably moving in Mitt Romney's direction,\" said Romney national political director Rich Beeson in an e-mailed memo.\nThe Romney campaign made clear it would have enough money to fund television advertising in the swing states by announcing his campaign had brought in more than $111 million from October 1 to October 17. The Romney campaign and its Republican allies reported having $169 million cash on hand for the final push.\n(Writing by Steve Holland; Editing by Alistair Bell; and Todd Eastham)","title":"Obama votes, picks up Powell endorsement amid swing state push","date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 12:00:00 GMT","media":[{"link":"http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?d=20121025&i=50324855&w=140&r=50324855-109_9&t=2","type":"image"},{"link":"http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20121025&t=2&i=667364374&w=&fh=&fw=&ll=460&pl=300&r=CBRE89O1QRK00","type":"image"}],"resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE89M11220121025?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/ZrX1eF5owv4/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE89M11220121025","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

He was convicted in Manhattan federal court last June for leaking Goldman Sachs boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager at the center of a U.S. government crackdown on insider trading over the past four years.\nSome legal experts said Wednesday's sentence came as a surprise, while others said the judge struck a fine balance.\nU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff told a somber courtroom audience, including Gupta's wife and four adult daughters, that the illegal sharing of corporate secrets at the height of the 2008 financial crisis \"was the functional equivalent of stabbing Goldman in the back.\"\nGupta, 63, gave no visible reaction to the sentence, which was given at the end of a 30-minute statement in which the judge spelled out the businessman's \"extraordinary\" philanthropy over decades that stood in stark contrast to his crimes.\nBill Gates, Microsoft Corp's co-founder, and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan were among 400 friends and luminaries who had written letters to the judge urging leniency.\nDuring the trial, the court heard how Gupta had tipped off his then friend and business associate Rajaratnam between September and October of 2008. Within minutes of a conference call of members of Goldman's board on September 23, 2008, Gupta told Rajaratnam that influential investor Warren Buffett was infusing $5 billion into the investment bank. Rajaratnam traded on the information as the market was closing.\nRakoff said during the two-and-a-half hour sentencing proceedings that the tip \"was not only overwhelming, but it was disgusting in its implications ... a terrible breach of trust\" at a time when Goldman Sachs was in turmoil.\nBut the judge also said: \"I have never encountered a defendant whose past history suggests such an extraordinary devotion ... to people in need.\"\nGupta had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for securities fraud and five years for conspiracy. Federal judges have wide leeway in sentencing and Rakoff has a reputation for veering from guidelines for courts in handing down punishment.\nMINIMUM SECURITY PRISON SOUGHT\nRakoff ordered Gupta to begin his sentence on January 8, 2013. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons will decide where, but his lawyer asked for the minimum security prison in Otisville, New York.\nThe judge denied Gupta's lawyer's bid to have him freed on bail pending an appeal, which could last as long as two years. His lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said in a statement that \"we believe the facts of this case demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is innocent.\"\nThe former Goldman director is the most influential corporate figure to be convicted in the wide U.S. probe of insider trading involving fund managers, traders, consultants and executives. He is a former global head of the McKinsey & Co management consultancy, and once sat on the boards of Procter & Gamble Co and American Airlines, as well advising philanthropies including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nGupta was born poor in India and orphaned as a teenager but rose to the top of the corporate and philanthropic elite.\nHis sentence was less than the eight to 10 years sought by prosecutors, but more than the probation and community service in Rwanda sought by Gupta's lawyers. The judge dismissed that proposal as \"a kind of Peace Corps for insider traders.\"\nIt was also less than some other insider trading defendants who were jailed for between four and 10 years. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence, one of the longest for insider trading.\nOn Thursday, a U.S. appeals court in New York is set to hear Rajaratnam's appeal. He argues prosecutors should not have been able to play phone taps of his conversations at his trial because he says they were improperly obtained.\n\"SANCTITY OF CORPORATE CONFIDENCE\"\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Richard Tarlowe argued for a sentence of at least eight years, telling the court \"Mr Gupta knew as much about the sanctity of these types of corporate confidences as anybody, and that's what makes it so shocking.\"\nNew York securities class action and shareholder rights lawyer Mark Rifkin said the judge \"understood both sides of the argument, and the relatively light sentence he imposed balances Gupta's misuse of his position against a lifetime of good work.\"\nBut Andrew Stoltmann, an attorney and investor rights advocate based in Chicago, wondered whether Gupta's \"Mother Teresa-like halo\" had warranted a sentence that was \"little more than a slap on the wrist.\"\n\"He had such an important role at some of these companies that it is kind of the ultimate betrayal of trust,\" he said.\nWhen Gupta addressed the court, he read from a statement for six minutes, using bland language that stopped short of fully admitting his conduct, but apologizing to \"extraordinary institutions and outstanding people\" and to his family.\n\"I feel terrible that they have been burdened with totally undeserved negative attention. I apologize to them and ask for their forgiveness,\" Gupta said.\nNaftalis, arguing for a lenient sentence, said his client had suffered a \"fall from grace of Greek tragedy proportions.\"\n\"This was an iconic figure who had been a role model for countless people around the globe,\" he said. \"He is no more.\"\nThe case is USA v Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-cr-907.\n(Editing by Martha Graybow, Matthew Lewis, Gary Hill and Paul Tait)","title":"Ex-Goldman director Gupta sentenced to two years' jail","date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 12:00:00 GMT","media":[{"link":"http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20121025&t=2&i=667007112&w=&fh=&fw=&ll=460&pl=300&r=CBRE89N1OXS00","primary":"true","type":"image"}],"resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/us-goldman-gupta-sentencing-idUSBRE89N06A20121025?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/G00v0DnTg5c/us-goldman-gupta-sentencing-idUSBRE89N06A20121025","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

The claim that we have failed to repurchase loans from Fannie Mae is simply false. At some point, Bank of America can't be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses that actually were caused by the economic downturn.\"\nIn February, Bank of America agreed to a $1 billion settlement of False Claims Act allegations over home loans submitted for insurance by the Federal Housing Administration, in a case from the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, New York.\nWHISTLEBLOWER\nSince Moynihan's predecessor, Kenneth Lewis, paid $2.5 billion for Countrywide, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has lost nearly $40 billion on mortgage litigation and investor demands to buy back soured loans, Credit Suisse said on October 5.\nSome of these costs related to Merrill Lynch & Co, which Lewis bought at the beginning of 2009. Last month, Bank of America agreed to pay $2.4 billion to settle a lawsuit accusing it of misleading investors about that takeover.\nAccording to court records, Wednesday's case was originally filed under seal in February by Edward O'Donnell, a Pennsylvania resident and former executive vice president at Countrywide Home Loans who had worked there between 2003 and 2009.\nIn that complaint, O'Donnell said Countrywide and later Bank of America dismissed his \"numerous\" objections to the Hustle, and that he became \"one of the lone voices\" in his division pointing to escalating loan quality issues and defaults.\nO'Donnell could not immediately be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBank of America shares closed down 5 cents at $9.31 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 61 percent since the Countrywide takeover closed, while the Standard & Poor's 500 has risen 10 percent.\nFHFA LAWSUITS\nFederal regulators seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on September 7, 2008 and put them into a conservatorship.\nThe mortgage financiers are now overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and have repaid only about one-fourth of the more than $188 billion of taxpayer funds they have drawn down. Fannie Mae alone has drawn down more than $116 billion.\nWednesday's lawsuit was also brought under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which was enacted after that decade's savings-and-loan crisis.\nIt overlaps other cases that federal agencies have brought against Wall Street over the financial crisis, including the FHFA's 18 lawsuits last year over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nThese lawsuits covered losses on the sales of roughly $200 billion of securities, including more than $57 billion linked to Bank of America, Countrywide and Merrill.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have in recent months stepped up their own efforts to force Bank of America and other lenders to buy back soured home loans.\nBharara's office has in the last 1-1/2 years brought five civil fraud lawsuits under the False Claims Act over FHA-insured loans against other lenders.\nIn February, Citigroup Inc settled its case for $158.3 million and Flagstar Bancorp Inc settled for $132.8 million, while Deutsche Bank AG settled in May for $202.3 million. Cases are pending against Wells Fargo & Co and Allied Home Mortgage Corp, Bharara said.\nThe case is U.S. ex rel. O'Donnell v.

China's factory output should grow faster in the last three months of 2012 than in the third quarter, though the recovery remains clouded by uncertainty in export markets, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said on Thursday.\nMonth-on-month improvements in output growth, an apparent turnaround signaled by a private sector survey of purchasing managers and an uptick in preliminary power generation data were all indications of a burgeoning recovery, the ministry spokesman and chief engineer, Zhu Hongren, told a news conference.\n\"The industry sector performance has shown signs of stabilization and we can see an even clearer growing trend from the month-on-month figures in the third quarter,\" Zhu said.\n\"Therefore, we expect that industrial output growth in the fourth quarter would be faster than that in Q3, which will help the country to achieve its annual economic growth target of 7.5 percent,\" he added.\nBut a ministry statement issued before the news conference began was focused more on the risks of weak external demand, rising production costs, financing strains and squeezed profit margins across China's industrial complex.\n\"The stabilization trend of China's industrial sector is not yet solid and we are still facing many challenges and difficulties to realize stable growth,\" the ministry's earlier statement said.\n\"Although export growth rebounded in September, it is still very difficult to see a stable growth in exports of industrial products in future due to shrinking external demand,\" the statement said.\nA festering debt crisis in China's biggest foreign market, the European Union, has dented demand for goods coming off assembly lines in the vast factory sector and ultimately weighed on the domestic economy.\nExports were worth 31 percent of GDP in 2011, according to the World Bank, and supported an estimated 200 million Chinese jobs.\nThe written statement echoes that from Commerce Ministry spokesman, Shen Danyang, who said last week that one month's solid trade data was not sufficient evidence of a recovery trend given complications in the external sector.\nA jump in annual export growth in September to 9.9 percent, roughly twice the rate expected by investors, has led some analysts to conclude that recovery in the external sector is gathering momentum.\nThe downturn in China's main markets has been the main cause of the rapidly cooling growth in the export-sensitive economy since 2011's 9.2 percent expansion.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters expect to China's economic growth to slow to 7.7 percent for the full year in 2012 - a 13 year low.\nRECOVERY SIGNS TENTATIVE\nTentative signs of recovery in China's vast factory sector though came on Wednesday in the HSBC China Flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for October, which showed new orders at their highest in six months and output at a three month peak.\nBut while the headline PMI index rose to a three month high of 49.1, it was still below the 50-point mark that separates expanding from shrinking business activity.\nIn the world's second biggest economy where industrial output expanded at a 9.2 percent annual rate in September, it implies that while China's factories are growing, they are doing so more slowly than previously.\nThe PMI survey also found, however, that stocks of purchases were their strongest since July while stocks of finished goods were at their weakest since March, which implies an upturn in orders will be met by a rise in factory output.\nChina's annual industrial output growth was 10 percent in the first nine months of 2012, leaving it below the Ministry's 11 percent target for the year.\nPremier Wen Jiabao said earlier this month that the economy is showing positive changes and the government is confident it can achieve its full-year economic growth target of 7.5 percent.\nBeijing has been following a program of pro-growth fine tuning of economic policies for a year and analysts broadly expect that to remain in place when a new leadership line-up of the ruling Communist Party is unveiled at a Congress next month.\nThe fine tuning includes two interest rate cuts, three reductions in the portion of deposits banks must keep as reserves (RRR) - freeing an estimated 1.2 trillion yuan ($190 billion) for lending.\nThere were also approvals in September for infrastructure projects worth about $157 billion, although Beijing has not said explicitly where the money to fund them is coming from.\nChina's overall economic growth accelerated to 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter from an upwardly revised 2.0 percent rate in the second quarter, data showed last week, further reinforcing views of some analysts that a recovery is beginning to take hold.\n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)","title":"China factories eye stronger fourth quarter, external risks remain","date":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 12:00:00 GMT","resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/us-china-economy-industry-idUSBRE89O05220121025?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/9kZZehjr0As/us-china-economy-industry-idUSBRE89O05220121025","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

Churkin seemed to confirm remarks Brahimi made earlier on Wednesday in Cairo, when he said the government had indicated its acceptance of the proposed truce.\nThe council issued a statement after the meeting supporting the ceasefire, which would begin on Friday and last for several days at least during the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha, and urging \"all regional and international actors to use their influence\" to ensure the truce is implemented.\n\"The members of the Council agreed that an Eid al-Adha ceasefire could be a first step towards a sustainable cessation of all violence,\" the council said.\nAfter Brahimi spoke to the press in Egypt, the Syrian government appeared to contradict him, saying that its military command was still studying the truce proposal.\n\"The answer will be announced tomorrow officially speaking,\" Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari told reporters. \"We have always been part of the solution, not part of the problem.\"\nBritish Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said Brahimi also contacted the opposition to persuade rebels to accept a temporary truce in the 19-month-old conflict that the United Nations says has killed around 30,000 people.\n\"He had been in touch with various parts of the opposition,\" Lyall Grant told reporters. \"Certainly the Free Syrian Army and other parts of the opposition had indicated that they were prepared to respond if the government took the first step in initiating the ceasefire over the Eid period.\"\nOn the way into the council meeting, Churkin said Moscow hoped Brahimi's plan would be successful.\n\"We support it very strongly,\" Churkin said. \"We worked very hard in support of Mr. Brahimi in making sure there is a chance that might happen.\"\nChinese Ambassador Li Baodong echoed Churkin's views.\n\"Hopefully we will see the truce, and also we want to see a sustainable ... cessation of all violence,\" Li told reporters after the council session.\nThe United States and European council members blame Russia, a staunch ally and key arms supplier for Assad's government, and China for the council's deadlock on the 19-month-long conflict.

She said Washington also was working with its friends and allies to promote more cohesion among the disparate Syrian opposition groups with the aim of producing a new leadership council following meetings scheduled for Doha in the next several weeks.\nOne envoy said Brahimi also told the Security Council that he needs its \"strong and unanimous support.\"\n\"Another failure would lead to extreme escalation and spillover to other countries,\" the diplomat, who was inside the meeting, paraphrased Brahimi as saying.\nU.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay also emphasized the need for the council to overcome its impasse on Syria in an address to the 193-nation General Assembly.\n\"While taking into account important political concerns, it is urgent to find ways to avert the massive loss of civilians and human rights violations,\" Pillay said.\n\"International law obliges states to protect their people, and where a state manifestly fails to carry out this obligation, then the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people,\" she said.\nRussia and China have repeatedly said they refuse to condone outside military intervention in Syria such as the NATO operation to protect civilians in Libya last year that led to the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his death at the hands of rebels who fought to oust him.\nBrahimi told the council there was no longer a single safe place for Syrian civilians in the country and that the army continued to shell indiscriminately, diplomats said.

Modest job gains, increased job security and record low mortgage rates are encouraging many to seek home ownership.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has targeted housing as a channel to boost growth, announcing last month that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities per month until the outlook for employment improved substantially.\nThe action helped push already low mortgage rates even lower. However, mortgage rates rose last week, dampening demand for loans to purchase homes during that period.\nThe Fed's monetary policy committee on Wednesday stuck to its ultra accommodative stance even as it acknowledged that some parts of the economy, including the housing market, were looking a bit better.\nMANUFACTURING SLUGGISH\nWhile the Fed's stimulus is supporting the consumption side of the economy, concerns about domestic fiscal policy and slowing global demand are hobbling the production side.\nIn a separate report, financial information firm Markit said its U.S. \"flash,\" or preliminary, Purchasing Managers Index for the manufacturing sector edged up to 51.3 this month from 51.1 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.\nA modest rise in output helped boost business conditions in the sector, which suffered its weakest quarter in three years during the July-to-September period.\nBut fewer orders from domestic clients and a fifth straight monthly decline in overseas demand for U.S. goods indicated manufacturing was acting as a drag on growth and employment, said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson.\n\"Purchasing managers report that the key to the ongoing weakness remains uncertainty among customers in export markets, notably Europe and Asia,\" he said.\nThe slowdown in factory activity is largely the result of fears that the U.S. Congress might fail to avoid the automatic tax hikes and government spending cuts that will suck about $600 billion out of the economy next year.\nThe housing data, however, showed no signs yet that the so-called fiscal cliff has crossed the radar of ordinary Americans.\nThe inventory of new homes on the market remained near record lows in September, although some economists worry a pick-up in building activity could undercut the market if sales do not rise significantly further.\nAt September's sales pace it would take 4.5 months to clear the new homes on the market, the fewest since October 2005 and down from 4.7 months in August.\nSales last month were up in three of the four regions. They tumbled 37.3 percent in the Midwest.\n(Additional reporting by Steven C.

At this point, the threat that they will arrest him if he sets foot outside the embassy still stands,\" Patino said, adding that Assange is \"suffering.\"\nAssange is said to be living a cramped life inside the embassy. He eats mostly take-out food and uses a treadmill to burn off energy and a vitamin D lamp to make up for the lack of sunlight.\nIn late August, the former computer hacker said he expected to wait six months to a year for a deal that would allow him to leave the embassy.\nThe Foreign Office said it was unaware of Assange's health problems.\n\"Ecuador have not told us that Mr Assange is ill. However, were they to do so, we would consider the matter,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman.\nEcuador granted Assange asylum in August and said it shared his fears that he could face charges in the United States over the publication by WikiLeaks in 2010 of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables.\nWhen he appeared on a balcony of the building to address supporters in August, Assange appeared tanned and in good health. But a BBC reporter who saw him recently described him as \"a very pale man\" in a story broadcast on Sunday.\nAssange, 41, broke the conditions of his bail when he entered the embassy after running out of legal options to avoid being sent to Sweden.\nSpeaking about the safe passage request he said Ecuador had lodged with the Foreign Office, Albuja Martinez said his country was pleased that Britain \"did not reject it outright\".\n\"We will not put pressure on them and will patiently await an answer, so that Assange can receive medical treatment if necessary,\" he was quoted as saying in Moscow.\n(Writing by Steve Gutterman and Maria Golovnina; Additional reporting by Eduardo Garcia in Quito; Editing by Xavier Briand)","title":"Ecuador fears for Assange's health, seeks UK safe passage","date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 12:00:00 GMT","resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-assange-russia-ecuador-britain-idUSBRE89N1KJ20121024?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/TltNw7WVzxU/us-assange-russia-ecuador-britain-idUSBRE89N1KJ20121024","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

I think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be,\" Clinton said during an appearance with the Brazilian foreign minister at the State Department.\nReuters reported on Tuesday that an official email showed officials at the White House and State Department were advised two hours after attackers assaulted the U.S. diplomatic mission on September 11 that an Islamic militant group had claimed credit.\nThe email, obtained by Reuters from government sources not connected with U.S. spy agencies or the State Department and who requested anonymity, specifically mentioned that the Libyan group called Ansar al-Sharia had asserted responsibility for the attacks.\nThat and two other emails also made available showed how U.S. diplomats described the attack, even as it was still under way, to Washington.\nClinton, responding to a reporter's question about the emails, noted that a State Department investigation was under way.\n\"The independent accountability review board is already hard at work looking at everything, not cherry picking one story here or one document there, but looking at everything - which I highly recommend as the appropriate approach for something as complex as an attack like this,\" she said.\n\"We will find out what happened. We will take whatever measures are necessary to fix anything that needs to be fixed and we will bring those to justice who committed these murders.\"\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney, asked about the emails, noted that Ansar al-Sharia had later denied responsibility for the attack.\n\"This was an open-source, unclassified email about a posting on a Facebook site. I would also note I think that within a few hours, that organization itself claimed that it had not been responsible. Neither should be taken as fact -- that's why there's an investigation under way,\" he told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One to Iowa.\nU.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Benghazi assault, which Obama and other U.S. officials ultimately acknowledged was a \"terrorist\" attack carried out by militants with suspected links to al Qaeda affiliates or sympathizers.\nAdministration spokesmen, including Carney, citing an unclassified assessment prepared by the CIA, maintained for days that the attacks likely were a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim film.\nWhile officials did mention the possible involvement of \"extremists,\" they did not lay blame on any specific militant groups or possible links to al Qaeda or its affiliates until intelligence officials publicly alleged that on September 28.\nThere were indications that extremists with possible al Qaeda connections were involved, but also evidence that the attacks could have erupted spontaneously, they said, adding that government experts were cautious about pointing fingers prematurely.\nU.S. intelligence officials have emphasized since shortly after the attack that early intelligence reporting about the attack was mixed.\nMISSIVES FROM LIBYA\nThe records obtained by Reuters consist of three emails dispatched by the State Department's Operations Center to multiple government offices, including addresses at the White House, Pentagon, intelligence community and FBI, on the afternoon of September 11.\nThe first email, timed at 4:05 p.m. Washington time - or 10:05 p.m. Benghazi time, 20-30 minutes after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission allegedly began - carried the subject line \"U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack\" and the notation \"SBU\", meaning \"Sensitive But Unclassified.\"\nThe text said the State Department's regional security office had reported that the diplomatic mission in Benghazi was under attack. \"Embassy in Tripoli reports approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well,\" it said.\nThe message continued: \"Ambassador Stevens, who is currently in Benghazi, and four ... personnel are in the compound safe haven. The 17th of February militia is providing security support.\"\nA second email, headed \"Update 1: U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi\" and timed 4:54 p.m. Washington time, said that the Embassy in Tripoli had reported that \"the firing at the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi had stopped and the compound had been cleared.\" It said a \"response team\" was at the site attempting to locate missing personnel.\nA third email, also marked SBU and sent at 6:07 p.m. Washington time, carried the subject line: \"Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack.\"\nThe message reported: \"Embassy Tripoli reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and has called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.\"\nWhile some information identifying recipients of this message was redacted from copies of the messages obtained by Reuters, a government source said that one of the addresses to which the message was sent was the White House Situation Room, the president's secure command post.\nOther addressees included intelligence and military units as well as one used by the FBI command center, the source said.\nIt was not known what other messages were received by agencies in Washington from Libya that day about who might have been behind the attacks.\nIntelligence experts caution that initial reports from the scene of any attack or disaster are often inaccurate.\nBy the morning of September 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, Reuters reported that there were indications that members of both Ansar al-Sharia, a militia based in the Benghazi area, and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African affiliate of al Qaeda's faltering central command, may have been involved in organizing the attacks.\nOne U.S. intelligence official said that during the first classified briefing about Benghazi given to members of Congress, officials \"carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information, relying on the best analysis available at the time.\"\nThe official added, however, that the initial analysis of the attack that was presented to legislators was mixed.\n\"Briefers said extremists were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous, there may have been a variety of motivating factors, and possible links to groups such as (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Ansar al-Sharia) were being looked at closely,\" the official said.\n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Andrew Quinn; Editing by Mary Milliken and David Storey)","title":"Facebook post about Benghazi attack not hard evidence","date":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 05:47:57 GMT","resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-usa-benghazi-emails-idUSBRE89N12020121024?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/p6pNQVy3jQo/us-usa-benghazi-emails-idUSBRE89N12020121024","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

Only a few days away by sea, Australia seemed tantalizingly close.\nSix hours into the voyage, the craft overturned. The two teenagers clung to the upturned hull. One by one, survivors lost purchase and drifted away, their dreams swallowed by the warm waters of the Java Sea.\n\"When the boat capsized, the dead bodies came floating above the water,\" Warasi said, recounting his ordeal in the Indonesian hill town of Puncak, just south of Jakarta. \"Our hearts were so sad for them and we were waiting for our own time when we would die.\"\nThe heroism that would ensure the pair survived 48 hours in the water is not merely testament to the bond of friendship that has united Warasi and Muhammad Muntaziri since their childhoods in the Pakistani city of Quetta.\nTheir determination is also a reflection of the ferocity of the persecution unleashed upon their ethnic Hazara community, who are almost all members of Pakistan's Shi'ite minority.\nIn the past year, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni extremist group, has turned Quetta into a hunting ground. Gunmen shoot Hazaras every few days while leaflets shoved under doorways warn they are infidels deserving of death.\nThousands choose to face the ocean's terrors rather than risk an encounter with the death squads stalking their city's streets.\n\"Mothers are selling their jewelry so that their sons can leave Quetta for abroad,\" said Khaliq Hazara, chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party, a Quetta-based political party. \"We are under siege.\"\nDETENTION CAMPS\nThe 10,000-km (6,000 miles) route from Quetta to established Hazara communities in the more genteel environs of Adelaide, Melbourne or Sydney is just one strand in an ever-shifting web of global migration.\nBut there are few starker examples of the impact troubles in faraway lands can have on domestic politics than Australia, where a growing influx of refugee boats has reignited a polarizing debate over immigration.\nThe government passed a law in August to revive a scheme to send asylum seekers rescued at sea to detention centers on far-flung Pacific islands.\nHuman rights groups condemned the move, saying people could be left languishing in malarial camps for years, isolated from relatives and unable to work.\nWarasi and Muntaziri's sheer desperation raises questions over how far the measures will discourage men and women whose quest for a new life has echoes of the voyages of European settlers to Australia in the late 18th century.\n\"Every day there were killings,\" said Warasi, recalling life in Quetta. \"We got chicken-hearted, like we were in a cage.\"\nA CITY DIVIDED\nOvershadowed by the forbidding hills that define the wild geography of the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, Quetta was once a town where ethnic groups and sects mingled freely. Today, LeJ is offering Hazaras a choice: leave or die.\nIn the neatly swept lanes of the Hazara enclave of Mehrabad, the fear is palpable. LeJ has turned swathes of Quetta into virtual no-go zones for Hazaras, who number perhaps 500,000 of the city's population of about two million.\nAs members of both an ethnic minority and Shi'ites, Hazaras make particularly attractive targets for extremists.\n\"If you went out in the morning you cannot be sure that you'd come back home,\" said Muhammad Mehdi, who closed his children's' clothing shop in an ethnically mixed market after gunmen went on a shooting spree in April. Like many Hazaras, he is now reluctant to set foot outside Mehrabad.\nIn the cheerfully decorated classrooms of the district's Ummat Public School, ambitious teenage girls fear their terrified parents will not allow them to venture into the city to attend college.\n\"We can be like Mark Zuckerberg, we can be like Bill Gates,\" said Farheen, 15. \"We can show the world that we are talented.\"\nA few minutes' drive away, grave-diggers have had to open a new section in the century-old Hazara cemetery to accommodate the rapidly growing number of gunshot and blast victims.\nActivists say at least 800-1,000 Hazaras have been killed since 1999 and the pace is quickening. More than one hundred have been murdered in and around Quetta since January, according to Human Rights Watch.\nThe state's failure to protect them has fuelled Hazaras's suspicions that elements within the security forces still support LeJ, which was nurtured by intelligence agencies in the 1990s as a proxy force.\nThere are no official figures for the number of Hazaras who have left for Australia, but community leaders say thousands of people like Warasi and Muntaziri have paid people smugglers $10,000-$15,000 to attempt the do-or-die trip.\nSTRUGGLE AT SEA\nFollowing the traffickers' instructions, the friends caught buses to Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi, then flights to Jakarta via Malaysia.\nOn the night of Dec 18, 2011, they boarded the fishing boat in the port of Surabaya. Like other migrant ships, it was bound for Christmas Island, a speck of Australian territory in the Indian Ocean.\nWhen the boat capsized, Muntaziri held his breath, wriggled through a porthole and broke the surface before finding his friend. After six hours, a fishing boat arrived and 34 people managed to swim to it.\nWhen he thought that Muntaziri would not make it, Warasi swam back to the wreck, ready to drown with his friend.\n\"Till we both die, we will help each other,\" Warasi said.\nSeveral boats passed, saw them but did not stop, Muntaziri said. They kept up their spirits by reminiscing about growing up in Quetta, but gradually passengers began to lose their grip on the capsized boat. By the time a coal ferry picked them up, only 13 remained alive. They had spent 48 hours in the water.\nThe pair have since sought shelter at a guest house run by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. For now, their lives are in limbo as they wait for an immigration process that seems designed to frustrate them. The possibility of risking all on another boat is almost too traumatic to contemplate - but so is the prospect of returning home.\nMuntaziri, a knowledge-hungry 17-year-old who speaks five languages, said all he wanted was to be safe.\n\"I am the one who has to take care of my family,\" he said. \"That is why I am going to Australia to start a new peaceful life away from the terror.\"\nDespite the risks, growing numbers of Pakistanis, Afghans, Sri Lankans and others are attempting the journey.\nAustralia recorded 5,175 boat arrivals in the fiscal year to July 2011, compared with 690 two years earlier. More than 6,000 people have arrived by boat just in the first three months of the fiscal year that began July 1.\nThe passage exacts a heavy toll. About 1,000 people have died en route from Indonesia to Christmas Island since 2001, according to an independent report. In the disaster survived by Warasi and Muntaziri, more than 270 were feared drowned.\n\"PACIFIC SOLUTION\"\nBattling accusations it is soft on immigration, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's Labor government has reactivated a plan to process boat arrivals on Pacific islands, reneging on its earlier opposition to it.\nThe \"Pacific Solution\" was adopted by Gillard's Conservative predecessor John Howard, whose tough stance helped him win elections in 2001 and 2004.\nPeople rescued at sea are sent to detention on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, or the Pacific nation of Nauru. They could spend up to five years in camps with no guarantee of final settlement in Australia. Those granted protection will no longer be able to sponsor their families to join them.\nThe first group of asylum seekers were sent to a tent city in Nauru in mid-September. When fully operating, Nauru will house around 1,500 people, and Manus Island about 600.\nThe policy aims to deter people smugglers by ensuring those who board boats will have no better chance of living in Australia than those who apply through official channels.\nSurvivors argue that many have resorted to the perilous journey precisely because it can take many years to apply for asylum legally, often with scant chance of success.\nThe debate in Australia has largely steered clear of the sort of inflammatory rhetoric seen in the late 1990s, when one lawmaker warned the country risked being swamped by Asians.\nBut not always: The host of a morning television show, Paul Henry, suggested the government whip asylum seekers arriving in Nauru. He later apologized.\nEarly signs suggest the \"Pacific Solution\" may be having an impact. Two groups of Sri Lankans returned home rather than risk being sent to an offshore camp and Hazaras in Karachi say some are reconsidering plans to start the voyage.\n\"They can't imagine four years in a detention center,\" said Eltaf Hussain, a student. \"Why not commit a crime in Quetta and just be locked in jail?\"\n(James Grubel reported from Canberra; writing by Matthew Green; editing by Bill Tarrant)","title":"Pakistani death squads spur desperate voyage to Australia","date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 12:00:00 GMT","media":[{"link":"http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20121025&t=2&i=667009794&w=&fh=&fw=&ll=460&pl=300&r=CBRE89N1QGM00","primary":"true","type":"image"}],"resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/us-pakistan-hazaras-idUSBRE89N1LP20121025?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/nts-RMijgYo/us-pakistan-hazaras-idUSBRE89N1LP20121025","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

The United Nations says they have systematically violated human rights, particularly of women.\nMali's Foreign Minister Tieman Hubert Coulibaly told state-owned television late on Wednesday that he was \"happy and satisfied\" with the lifting of the suspension.\nHe said it was the result of Mali's \"respect of signed agreements and the creation of a government of national union conforming to the demands of the international community.\"\nIt was not immediately clear, however, whether Mali had agreed to the AU's poll deadline. The government in Bamako does not have a seat at the AU's Peace and Security Council (PSC), which is comprised of a rotating body of members.\nNor was it clearly stated whether the vote would come before or after any military intervention against rebels in the north of the country where Bamako now has no control.\n\"We are working ... to finalize the joint planning for the early deployment of an African-led international military force to help Mali recover the occupied territories in the North,\" Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chairwoman of the AU Commission, told ministers at the opening of Wednesday's PSC meeting.\n\"At the same time, we will leave the door of dialogue open to those Malian rebel groups willing to negotiate,\" she said.\nWhen the meeting concluded, Ramtane Lamamra, the AU's peace and security commissioner, told reporters the council had voted to reinstate Mali.\nThe AU suspended Mali's membership days after mutinous soldiers staged a coup against then President Amadou Toumani Toure. In April, an interim president, Dioncounda Traore, was sworn in but there remain doubts about who really holds the reins of power even in the government-controlled south of Mali.\nMILITARY CAPACITY DOUBTS\nMali remains crippled by twin crises. The leadership in Bamako is still divided after the coup and the north of the country is occupied by Islamic militants.\nThe proposed path to elections was part of a \"strategic concept\" endorsed by the council that outlined measures including defense and security reforms to help end the turmoil in Mali.\n\"The road map provides for elections to be held 12 months after the return to constitutional order, meaning April,\" Lamamra told Reuters after the meeting.\nBefore then, Lamamra said, Mali's authorities would have to come up with their own plan for holding elections.\nThe document said Mali's return to the AU fold would help establish an inclusive political authority.\nRegional and international efforts to deal with the situation, which has created a safe haven for Islamists and international criminal gangs, have been hampered by divisions over how to help.\nForeign envoys have voiced concern that the AU's request for U.N. backing in June lacked the necessary details, while others have spoken of serious reservations about the ability of the ECOWAS regional grouping to tackle the northern Islamists anytime soon.\nSome envoys predict it could be months before any military operation is put in motion.\nGermany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said on Tuesday Europe must help restore security in Mali and could lend support through military training to an African-led mission.\n(Additional reporting by Adama Diarra in Bamako; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Michael Roddy and Andrew Osborn)","title":"African Union reinstates Mali ahead of military action","date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 12:00:00 GMT","media":[{"link":"http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20121024&t=2&i=666945014&w=&fh=&fw=&ll=460&pl=300&r=CBRE89N1N5400","primary":"true","type":"image"}],"resolved_url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-mali-au-suspension-idUSBRE89N1MA20121024?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29","url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/Rm1dbYBe0n4/us-mali-au-suspension-idUSBRE89N1MA20121024","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/SPAN[1]"}

Here's what we said about the opposition to Morsi's moves:\n\"Outrage had been spilling into the streets and around the presidential palace in Cairo over Morsi's executive decree and the proposed constitution, which the opposition says leaves out the rights of women, secular Egyptians and Christians.\"\nAl Arabiya, reporting from Sunday's news conference, quoted a coalition spokesman, saying: \"Egypt now is in a real revolution against the rule of the Brotherhood.\"\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that a national dialogue committee said the Dec. 15 referendum on the draft constitution will be held on schedule.\nYou can read a background of the events that led to the current impasse in Egypt here.\nUpdate at 3:17 p.m. ET, Morsi Orders Military To Maintain Security\nThe president has ordered the military to maintain security and protect state institutions until after the results of the Dec. 15 referendum. That's according to The Associated Press, which said the decision was published in the official gazette on Sunday.","title":"Egyptian Opposition Calls For Protests Against Referendum On Constitution : NPR","date":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 02:26:54 GMT","type":"article","media":[{"link":"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/12/09/ap367258342605_sq-328832c72faf9613c39c2bb37601188b131b4155.jpg?s=16","primary":"true","type":"image"},{"link":"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/12/08/mideast_egypt_14480473_sq-e6c8fe71e2ab99b1da7a5eb9e2701333d201860d.jpg?s=16","type":"image"},{"link":"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/12/08/13037241_h20334047_sq-20bcc47b3f934674c5b9edc075a371ab3c5ecdd5.jpg?s=16","type":"image"}],"url":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/12/09/166833112/egyptian-opposition-calls-for-protests-against-referendum-on-constitution?ft=1","xpath":"/HTML[1]/BODY[1]/DIV[1]/DIV[1]/SECTION[1]/ARTICLE[1]/DIV[2]"};
